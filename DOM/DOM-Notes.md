# DOM Notes

What is the DOM!?

DOM stands for Document Object Model
DOM is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.
It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects.

The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
