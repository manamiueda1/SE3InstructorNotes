Functional VS Class Components

Functional component -> stateless component

class component -> stateful component

constructor -> each class function has a constructor where that takes in parameters.

class methods -> You can define methods/functions inside a class funciton

instantiating a class function -> class Developer() would be instantiated using the 'new' key word: new Developer()
